Summary: A quick update on this website

Welcome to [`mackeracher.com`](https://mackeracher.com)! This is my
personal website, recently updated.

## What's all this?

I'm hoping to use this space to collect my thoughts on computer
programming, entrepreneurship, maths, music, or general life events. I
like reading and writing, and it might be nice to publish some of what
I write. Maybe some intrepid sailors of the information high seas will
find some utility here. Or maybe not.

## Themes, ideas, plans

No promises to update this website regularly. When I do publish any
posts, they'll likely be about using Emacs, programming with Clojure,
functional programming, entrepreneurship, financial technology, or
Canada.
